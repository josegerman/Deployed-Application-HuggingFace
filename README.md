This project was used to build, train and deploy a regression model which predicts house prices based on parameters entered by the user.<br>
Dataset used is dated so prices are not current. House prices are impacted by many other variables other than features alone.<br>

The regression notebook is used to train the regression model and then serialize into randomforestregresor_model.pkl.<br>
The app's interface is built in app.py.
